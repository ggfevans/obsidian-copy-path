# Copy Path

This is a simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that adds context menu actions for copying the full or vault relative paths of files and folders.

## Features

- **Vault Path Copying**: Copy the relative path of files and folders within your Obsidian vault
- **Full Path Copying**: Copy the complete system path of files and folders
- **Context Menu Integration**: Access copy functions directly from right-click context menus
- **Folder Path Formatting**: Optional trailing slash for folder paths to distinguish them from files
- **Configurable Actions**: Enable or disable specific copy actions based on your workflow needs

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings** → **Community Plugins**
2. Click **Browse** to open the Community Plugins browser
3. Search for "Copy Path" in the plugin directory
4. Click **Install** on the Copy Path plugin
5. After installation, click **Enable** to activate the plugin

Alternatively, you can [download](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=copy-path) the plugin directly from the official Community Plugins repository.

### Using the Plugin

1. **Right-click** on any file or folder in the File Explorer panel
2. Select one of the available copy options from the context menu:
   - **Copy vault path**: Copies the relative path within your vault (e.g., `folder/note.md`)
   - **Copy full path**: Copies the complete system path (e.g., `C:\Users\username\vault\folder\note.md`)
3. The path is automatically copied to your clipboard and ready to paste

## Configuration

### Plugin Settings

Access the plugin settings through **Settings** → **Community Plugins** → **Copy Path** → **Options**.

Available configuration options:

- **"Copy vault path" context menu action**: Show the option to copy the vault path of a file or folder
- **"Copy full path" context menu action**: Show the option to copy the full path of a file or folder
- **"Add trailing slash to folder paths"**: When enabled, folder paths will end with a trailing slash (e.g., `folder/`) to distinguish them from files. This applies to both vault and full path copying
